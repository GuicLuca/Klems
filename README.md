Join the map with friends. Each part of the ground will gradually become infected. 
You must avoid them at all costs in order to survive this experience.
However you are not alone in the cage... Kill or be killed, what will you choose?

You then lose your weapons but you can still eat your opponents! The infection that embodies you considerably increases your damage, 
which makes you a formidable target in close combat.
